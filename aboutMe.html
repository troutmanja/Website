                    <hr/><br>
                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 12pt">I am a Ph.D. student in Civil Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, advised by Dr. Charles Werth (in Civil Engineering) and Dr. Simon Humphrey (in Chemistry). My research straddles the line, linking <b style="color: #E87837">inorganic chemical synthesis</b> with environmental engineering, specifically <b style="color: #E87837">water treatment</b>. In my work, I synthesize novel alloy nanomaterials that are used as catalysts for the hydrogenative reduction of contaminants, especially those from agricultural practices (<i>e.g.</i>, nitrate, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>). I received my B.S. in Chemistry and Mathematics from Wingate University (Wingate, NC) in 2017 before moving to UT Austin for graduate school. My research allows me to continue following my passion for chemistry but also allows me to apply my skills for the benefit of both people and the environment through engineering.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 12pt">I grew up on a farm, with a dad who thought he could grow enough vegetables to feed our entire county and a grandfather who continued to raise cattle much to the chagrin of my grandmother, my dad, my mom, and my aunts/uncles. Seeing their attitude towards, and their respect for, the environment played a major role in my life and the directions I have taken. As I have gotten older, my interests have expanded to include the nexus of <b style="color: #E87837">F</b>ood, <b style="color: #E87837">E</b>nergy and <b style="color: #E87837">W</b>ater <b style="color: #E87837">S</b>ystems (<b style="color: #E87837">FEWS</b>). It is essential that we understand how these systems interact and play a role in today's society, as we deal with growing populations and a changing climate.</p>
                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 12pt">When I am not in the lab, I am mostly outside. I love to bike, and exploring from two wheels allows me to see new sites. I also enjoy long drives and getting to see new things. My other passions include music, primarily rock, folk and bluegrass, and books. One of my favorite aspects of living in Austin is getting to experience the live music scene, especially the bluegrass jams that occur throughout the city. If you catch me reading, chances are it will be a book by Tolkien, and I often find myself getting lost in Middle Earth and its numerous cultures.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Nanoparticle Synthesis</b><br>
                    Microwave heating can provide several benefits over more traditional convective heating methods. Additionally, synthetic routes based off microwave heating are more receptive to scaling. I explore the effects of microwave heating for the synthesis of multimetallic nanoparticles.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Noble Metal Alloys</b><br>
                    Combinations of noble and non-noble metals can induce synergistic effects that alter the surface properties (<i>e.g.</i>, catalytic activity) of alloyed materials. Additionally, the inclusion of non-noble metals can lessen our dependence on rare noble metals.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Heterogeneous Catalysis</b><br>
                    Heterogeneous catalysts provide a surface on which reactions can be more easily monitored and analyzed. These insights can provide better mechanistic knowledge. These catalysts can also be more easily recovered, extending catalyst life.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify" style="font-size: 12pt"><b>Drinking Water Treatment</b><br>
                    Access to clean drinking water is a notable concern, both in developing and developed countries. To help provide this access, ground- and surface water treatments need to be improved. I study how catalysis can be used to destroy inorganic contaminants in a potable water setting.</p>
