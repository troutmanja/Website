                    <p class="research-desc">
                    Ruthenium alloys containing other late Transition metals (<i>e.g.</i>, copper, silver, gold) are immiscible in the bulk phase. While a handful of recent publications have demonstrated that  these combinations are stable at the nanoscale, we still have little knowledge of their catalytic properties. Our goal is to show that microwave heating can be used to synthesize stable ruthenium&#8211;metal nanoparticles (Ru<sub><i>x</i></sub><i>Me</i><sub>100-<i>x</i></sub>NPs) with tunable compositions (<i>i.e.</i>, <i>x</i> = 10&#8211;90). The implications of <i>Me</i> choice, as well as composition, on the catalytic activity of these particles will then be explored <i>via</i> studying several model gas- and aqueous-phase reduction reactions.<br>

                    <p class="research-desc">
                    Both palladium (Pd) and ruthenium (Ru) catalysts are active for NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction in drinking water. However, Pd catalysts display near-complete selectivity for N<sub>2</sub> gas as the end-product, while Ru catalysts tend towards ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). We hypothesize that tunable Ru<sub><i>x</i></sub>Pd<sub>100-<i>x</i></sub>NPs will provide tunable selectivities for N<sub>2</sub> or NH<sub>3</sub> based on the ratio of Ru:Pd (the value of <i>x</i>). Using microwave heating-assisted synthesis, we intend to synthesize a range of Ru<sub><i>x</i></sub>Pd<sub>100-<i>x</i></sub>NPs to study in as catalysts in a batch reactor setting.<br>

    				<p class="research-desc">
    				Catalytic hydrogenation of aqueous nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>) requires the combination of palladium (Pd) with an oxophilic promoter metal (<i>e.g.</i>, indium, In; copper, Cu). Much effort has focused on optimizing the weight loading of Pd and the promoter metal, but the mechanism of interaction between the two in relation to distance is not well understood. Here, well-defined In nanocubes (InNCs) will be used as seeds to direct the growth of Pd branches to form indium&#8211;palladium nanostructures (In&#8211;Pd NSs). These structures will then be used as NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reduction catalysts and compared to separately supported Pd,In catalysts. The project has two goals: 1) show that we can synthesize two-phase nanostructures of Pd and In (transition metal and metalloid), and 2) better understand how Pd and the promoter metal In work together to reduce NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>.<br>

    				Alloys consisting of hydrogenation active metals (<i>e.g.</i>, Pd) and non-active metals (<i>e.g.</i>, Au, Ag, Cu) can display enhanced reactivities due to ligand and ensemble effects between the metal atoms. Combining Pd with less expensive metals, such as Ag, also provides an attractive route for lowering catalyst cost. Herein, the effect of alloy composition (the value of <i>x</i>) on catalyst activity for the reduction of aqueous-phase nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>) was investigated. Results showed that Pd-rich particles (<i>i.e.</i>, high values of <i>x</i>) showed the highest activity for NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> destruction, though all alloys provided enhanced cost-normalized activities when compared to monometallic Pd.<br>

    				<p class="research-desc">
    				Depsite the two metals being completely miscible, the synthesis of palladium&#8211;silver nanoparticles (PdAgNPs) has rarely been reported. Here, I optimized the synthesis of PdAgNPs <i>via</i> microwave-assisted heating (&mu;w). Previously published strategies (Garc&iacute;a, 2014; Kunal, 2016) were adapted to prevent the loss of Ag by precipitation with counter ions. The synthesis method allowed for randomly alloyed particles with finely tunable compositions. Combining Pd with Ag in catalysts represents a convenient route for reducing the costs of Pd-based catalysts, and &mu;w synthesis is an ideal method that can be easily scaled.<br>
